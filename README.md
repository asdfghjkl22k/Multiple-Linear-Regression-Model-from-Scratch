# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-from-Scratch
A hands-on dive into Multiple Linear Regression — predicting student performance using a kaggle Student Performance dataset. From scratch, no fancy libraries, just pure math, patience, and code.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Multiple Linear Regression from scratch** using Python, NumPy, and Pandas — no `sklearn`!  
It predicts a student's **Performance Index** based on:
- Study Hours
- Sleep Hours
- Number of Papers

The model is trained using **Gradient Descent** and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Study Hours` – Number of hours spent studying per day.
- `Sleep Hours` – Average hours of sleep per day.
- `Sample Question Papers Practiced` – Previous Score.
- `Performance Index` – Target performance score.
